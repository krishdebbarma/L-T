# In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).


age = 34 # interger
name = "Krish" # string
cgpa = 4.55 # float


# 34age = 4 # Invalid because variable cannot start with a number
# a$$ge = 4 # Invalid because variables cannot contain special characters pther than _ underscores
